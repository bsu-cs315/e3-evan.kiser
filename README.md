### Report
- Core Loop: The game can be played from beginning to end. There is a way to start, gameplay that involves flinging a object in 3D space, and a clear end to gameplay, and the game can be restarted without needing to reopen the application.
- Clean: The project has neither errors nor warnings. The style guides have been followed. The project structure is appropriate. Conventional rules of code quality, such as Clean Code, are followed.
- Legal: I have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked above, and I have satisfied all license requirements.
- Versioning: The repository is properly configured, in the course organization with no extraneous files tracked, with a single mainline branch, and with all commits following Beams' rules. A Release on GitHub and corresponding tag mark the increment.
- Documentation: The report is complete as described in the first week's exercise.
